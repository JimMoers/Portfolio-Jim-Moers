For this project my corpus will be about three artists: Floating Points, Pharoa Sanders and the London Symphony Orchestra. These are three artist from very different genres. Floating Points makes mostly idm and dance music, Pharoa Sanders is known for his free jazz and avant-garde jazz and the London Symphony Orchestra plays classical music. However, these three artists released the collaborative album Promises last year, which combines their electronic, jazz and classical sounds. In my reasearch I want to compare the work of the individual artists to their collaborative albums. With this I think it could be interesting to see where the similarities and the differences are of the artists. To represent each artist I will be using their "this is..." playlist from spotify, which are collections of 50 songs chosen by spotify that represent the artists most. Each artist also has some songs from their collaborative album on their "this is..." playlist. These will be excluded from the individuak analysis.
